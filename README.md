# Asteroids

Clone of classic arcade game asteroids, written in Python 2. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy asteroids and flying saucers while not colliding with either or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire. The number of asteroids increases as more asteroids are destroyed. Every 30 seconds a new flying saucer appears. You have 3 lives to begin with and gain an extra one for every 10,000 points you score.
